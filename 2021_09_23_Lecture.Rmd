We can use gitignore to ignore the files that we don't want to commit, for example, write line "/data" so that we cannot commit the data folder. 


# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
