## Piviot longer

Load the PULSE data

```{r}
pulse_df = 
  read_sas("data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Let's try to pivot

```{r}
# if your variable share the same prefix and you don't need that prefix in everything, use names_prefix ="the part u don't want"
#
pulse_tidy = 
  pulse_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m, #taking the columns from bl to 12m
    names_to = "visit",         #pivot the column to a variable names visit
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_", # getting rid of the prefix bdi_score_
    values_to = "bdi"   
    #pivot all the value from original column bl-12m to a variable names bdi
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    visit = replace(visit, visit == "bl", "00m"), 
    #replacing bl with 00m to have consistent naming
    visit = factor(visit) # converting visit to a factor variable 
  )
```
