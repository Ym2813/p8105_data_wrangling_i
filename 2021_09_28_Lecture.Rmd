## Import some data

I want to import `FAS_litters.csv`;

```{r}
# taken directly from the data folder in our current directory
litters_df = read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

pups_df = read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_df = janitor::clean_names(pups_df)
```

## `Select`

Let's select some columns.

```{rï¼Œ eval=FALSE}
#select cols that I'm interested about
select(litters_df, group, litter_number)
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight, gd18_weight)

#taking everything from gd0_weight to gd_of_birth
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth)

#everything except litter number 
select(litters_df, -litter_number)

#start with or end with 
select(litters_df, grouos, starts_with("pups"))

#rename a col
select(litters_df, GROUP = group, litter_number)

#not selecting anything, but renaming 
rename(litters_df, GROUP = group)

# select in the order that i want/ relocate litter number to the first col
select(litters_df, litter_number, everything())

#similarly, we can do 
relocate(litters_df,litter_number)

select(litters_df,group) #gives a data frame with just one col

#pull(litters_df, group) #extract out the col
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#exercise: select the columns containing litter number, sex, and pd ears from pups data
select(pups_df, litter_number, sex, pd_ears)
```
