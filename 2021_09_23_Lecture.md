Simple document
================

We can use gitignore to ignore the files that we don’t want to commit,
for example, write line “/data” so that we cannot commit the data
folder.

# Section 1

Here’s a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is 0.1345453.
