Tidy Data

## Piviot longer

Load the PULSE data

``` r
pulse_df = 
  read_sas("data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Let’s try to pivot

``` r
# if your variable share the same prefix and you don't need that prefix in everything, use names_prefix ="the part u don't want"
#
pulse_tidy = 
  pulse_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m, #taking the columns from bl to 12m
    names_to = "visit",         #pivot the column to a variable names visit
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_", # getting rid of the prefix bdi_score_
    values_to = "bdi"   
    #pivot all the value from original column bl-12m to a variable names bdi
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    visit = replace(visit, visit == "bl", "00m"), 
    #replacing bl with 00m to have consistent naming
    visit = factor(visit) # converting visit to a factor variable 
  )
view(pulse_tidy)
```

## Pivot\_wider example

make up a results data table

``` r
analysis_df = 
  tibble(
    group = c("treatment", "treatment", "control","control"),
    time = c("a","b","a","b"),
    group_mean = c(4,8,3,6)
  )

analysis_df %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "time",
    values_from = "group_mean"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable() #formatting the table so it's easier read 
```

| group     |   a |   b |
|:----------|----:|----:|
| treatment |   4 |   8 |
| control   |   3 |   6 |

## Biding rows

import the LotR movie words data sheet

``` r
fellowship_df = 
  read_excel("data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "B3:D6") %>% 
  mutate(movie = "fellowship_rings")

two_towers_df = 
  read_excel("data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "F3:H6") %>% 
  mutate(movie = "two_towers")

return_df = 
  read_excel("data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "J3:L6") %>% 
  mutate(movie = "return_king")

#instead of solving the untidiness in each one when we created them, we can combine all three together first and then tidy it 

lotr_df = 
  bind_rows(fellowship_df, two_towers_df, return_df) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    female:male,
    names_to = "sex",
    values_to = "words"
  ) %>%
  mutate(race = str_to_lower(race)) %>%  
#making all races to lowercase, if you want to keep the original and have a new variable with race in lowercase, write "mutate(race_lower = str_to_lower(race))" instead. 
  relocate(movie)
```

use `rbind()` or `bind_rows` ? pretty much the same thing, like
`read.csv` vs `read_csv`. `rbind()` is worse, so don’t use
